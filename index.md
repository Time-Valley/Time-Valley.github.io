# Welcome to My Site!

Hi! Jiaxiang here. Currently I'm a second-year graduate student in Physics at Caltech, working in Prof. Yanbei Chen's group at TAPIR. My interest in research currently lies in the foundational causal aspect of physics theory: causal structure of spacetime, causality issues in electrodynamics, etc.
